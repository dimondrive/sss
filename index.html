        <h1 class="gameTable-title">What is Game Table?</h1>
        <p>Game Table allows you to create and play table-top experiences like board games or card games. For games with no hidden information, like chess, Figma already allows you to play with others by joining the same document and moving your respective pieces. However, for games with hidden infromation, like poker and most games, Figma doesn’t natively have any way to show information to only one player. This is the core of what Game Table does, along with utility functionality such as shuffling and tidying pieces up. In this tutorial, we will be using a standard 52-card deck as an example, but later we will show you how to make any game.</p>
